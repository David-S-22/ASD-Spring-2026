# Bills extended agentic loop

A terminal Plan → Act → Observe → Adapt review loop over the group app, with
four review modes. This is my individual, extended counterpart to the shared
loop in [#78](https://github.com/David-S-22/ASD-Spring-2026/pull/78): the same
four-stage workflow and the same `MODES` extension point, but where the shared
loop reviews files only, the service modes here observe the running system.

Run it from the repository root:

```
python -m sophia.agentic_loop.main
```

## The four modes

| Mode | What it observes |
|---|---|
| Architecture | Compose services and host ports, dependency edges, derived student directories, required-directory check, shared entry point |
| Database | Row counts over HTTP from every `*-db` service compose defines, against the ten-row seed minimum |
| Endpoints | Status and latency for every `*-backend` health route, plus the thirteen documented Bills GET routes |
| DevOps | Workflow files, their jobs, which student directory each watches, and the latest run conclusion on `main` via `gh` |

Ports are parsed from `docker-compose.yml` at run time, never hardcoded, so
the loop keeps working when the team moves a port. A service that does not
answer is recorded as a finding, not raised as an error — "unreachable" and
"empty" are different observations with different causes.

Only GET routes are swept. The loop never writes to another feature.

## Why it lives here, and why its prompts are its own set

The shared loop is the team's and lives at the repository root; this one is my
individual work and lives entirely inside `sophia/`. Nothing outside `sophia/`
is created, imported at start-up, or written to.

The prompt assets under `prompts/` are deliberately a separate set from the
root `prompts/`. Sharing them would make this loop depend on the shared one
being merged first; keeping them here means it runs either way. That is a
choice, not an oversight.

## Layout

```
main.py                     the menu, the four stages, the ADAPT prompt
collect.py                  the four collect functions -- no model calls, no writes
record.py                   writes reports/report.json, report.md, run-view.md
prompts/_common/            the persona and the reviewer brief, one copy each
prompts/<family>/           task_prompt.txt -- the only per-mode prompt
reports/                    run output, self-ignoring
```

The prompts split by what varies, not by mode. Both stages address the same
reviewer with the same evidence discipline, so the persona
(`_common/system_prompt.txt`) and the reviewer brief
(`_common/review_prompt.txt`) are written once; only the task — what to look
at and what to report — changes per mode. Holding four byte-identical copies
of each said the opposite, and made a wording fix a four-file edit.

Per-family overrides were deliberately not built. No mode has yet needed its
own persona, and a lookup that falls back from `<family>/` to `_common/` would
add a branch to `read_prompt` for a case that does not exist. If one is ever
needed, adding it is a smaller change than carrying the indirection now.

The shared loop keeps the per-family triplet
(`prompts/<family>/implementation/{system,task}_prompt.txt` and
`review/review_prompt.txt`) exactly as PR #78 defines it — the root `prompts/`
tree is untouched by this package.

`main.py` names two roots separately, which matters because this package sits
two levels down rather than at the repository root:

```python
FEATURE_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent   # prompts, reports
REPO_ROOT    = FEATURE_ROOT.parent.parent        # compose, workflows, students
```

Collapsing them into one — as the root version's
`Path(__file__).parent.parent` does correctly for its own location — would
resolve to `sophia/` here and silently point every collector at the wrong
tree. `main()` checks `REPO_ROOT / "docker-compose.yml"` at start-up and exits
with a readable message rather than producing empty evidence.

## Configuration

All optional; the defaults match the team's compose file.

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:0.5b` (implementation stage) |
| `OLLAMA_REVIEW_MODEL` | `llama3.1:8b` (review stage) |

The model is called over plain HTTP with `requests`, so there is no SDK
dependency — `requests` and `PyYAML` are the only requirements, both already
in `sophia/requirements.txt`.

### Which ollama answers

The default names `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`, and the difference is
not cosmetic. On Windows `localhost` resolves to both `127.0.0.1` and `::1`.
If a desktop Ollama is installed as well as the composed `ollama` service,
they end up on one socket each — and `requests` takes IPv4 while `curl` takes
IPv6, so the two disagree about which models exist without either appearing to
fail. Every run of this loop before 1 September 2026 reached a host-installed
Ollama for that reason. It went unnoticed because both instances happened to
serve `qwen2.5:0.5b` and `llama3.1:8b`.

The fix is ordering, not just the address: the desktop app has to release the
IPv4 socket before Docker's port proxy can claim it. Quit the desktop Ollama,
`docker compose restart ollama`, then confirm `0.0.0.0:11434->11434/tcp` in
`docker ps`.

Every run now records the endpoint it used and the model list that endpoint
served, in all three report files. That list is the fingerprint — on this
machine only the container holds `qwen2.5:3b` — so a reader can tell which
instance produced a run instead of taking it on trust. `docker exec ollama
ollama ps` is the matching check from the container's side.

## Tests

`test_loop_collect.py`, `test_loop_record.py` and `test_loop_endpoint.py` under
`sophia/test/` cover the deterministic parts: host-port parsing in all three
compose forms, the architecture collector against a fixture repository, the
workflow parser, the record writer including the environment block, and the
endpoint fingerprint with `requests.get` replaced. No model calls, no sockets,
no Docker — they run in CI with the rest of the Bills suite.

## Adding a mode

Add one `prompts/<family>/task_prompt.txt` and one entry to `MODES` in
`main.py`; the persona and reviewer brief are inherited from `_common/`. The
menu numbers itself from `MODES`, so a directory under `prompts/` never
becomes a mode on its own.
